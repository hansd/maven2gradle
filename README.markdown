This tool obtains  the effective pom of the current project, reads its dependencies and generates build.gradle scripts.

Features list:
==============
* Uses effective pom and effective settings (support for pom inheritance, dependency management, properties)
* Supports both single module and multimodule projects
* Generates settings.gradle for multimodule projects
* Supports custom module names (that differ from directory names)
* Generates general metadata - id, description and version
* Applies maven, java and war plugins (as needed)
* Supports packaging war projects as jars if needed
* Generates dependencies (both external and inter-module)
* Generates download repositories (inc. local maven repository)
* Adjusts java compiler settings
* Supports packaging of sources and tests
* Supports testng runner
* Generates global exclusions from Maven enforcer plugin settings

To do:
=================
* Generate deployment settings (with support to optional dependencies and provided scope in generated pom.xml)

Installation:
=============
* Note: Current version only works with Gradle 1.0-RC-Milestone-6
* Note: Current version only works with Maven 3.0+ (see FAQ for the Maven 2 exception. Contribute a pull request if you can solve it.)
* Run the `./gradlew installIntoGradle` task and you are good to go. This will:
    * Put the maven2gradle jar into $GRADLE_HOME/lib
    * Put the batch files into $GRADLE_HOME/bin

Usage:
============
* Run maven2gradle batch in the root of the converted project

 Available options:
 -----------------
*   -verbose prints the obtained effective pom
*   -keepFile saves the obtained effective pom

Note: Your project will be considered multi-module only if your reactor is also a parent of at least one of your modules. Why so? Reactor project is built last, when Parent project is built first. I need reactor to be built first, because effective-pom Mojo generates needed output only if it founds modules in first project it encounters. Making reactor also a parent achieves this.
